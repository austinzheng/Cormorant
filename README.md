Lambdatron
==========

An interpreter for a simple Lisp dialect, implemented in Swift. Syntax and conventions are modeled off [Clojure's](http://clojure.org/). Eventual goal is a library that can be used independently of the REPL front-end.

The name is provisional and will be changed once I come up with something better.


Application
-----------

Lambdatron is an OS X command-line application written in Swift. You will need Xcode 6.1 or later to build. Type expressions at the command prompt and press 'Enter'.

Need ideas? Try:

**Basic arithmetic**

- `(+ (* 2 4) (- 8 6) (+ (+ 1 3) 4))`

**Working with lists**

- `(cons 1 '(2 3 4))`
- `(rest '(1 2 3 4 5))`

**Defining and calling a function**

- `(def myfunc (fn [a b] (+ a b 1)))`, then `(myfunc 10 20)`
- Functions returning functions: `(def f1 (fn [arg1] (fn [arg2] (+ arg1 arg2))))`, then `(let [plusone (f1 1)] (plusone 3))`

**Recursion and iteration**

- Basic recursion: `(def r (fn [a] (print a " ") (if (> a 0) (r (- a 1)))))`, then `(r 10)`
- Tail-call recursion using recur: `(def recadd (fn [mylist sofar] (if (= (first mylist) nil) sofar (recur (rest mylist) (+ (first mylist) sofar)))))`, then `(recadd '(1 2 3 4 5) 0)`
- Iteration using loops: `(loop [a 10 b 0] (if (= a 0) b (recur (- a 1) (+ b a))))`

**Creating and using a macro**

- `(defmacro when [predicate then-do] (list 'if predicate then-do nil))`, then `(when (= 1 1) "good")` or `(when (= 1 2) "bad")`


### Current Limitations

Lambdatron has a couple of limitations, due mostly to its work-in-progress status:

- The REPL is fragile. Don't press the arrow keys while inside it, for example. Copy-pasting text works fine.
- The REPL can only take one form at a time.
- There currently isn't any namespacing or symbol mangling, so be careful when defining macros (e.g. don't use `& rest` as a vararg).
- Macros are cumbersome to define since the syntax-quote system hasn't yet been implemented.

These will disappear as the feature set is filled out.


Features
--------

Lambdatron has the following features:

**Lists**, the bread and butter of Lisp. Create a list using `cons`, extract the first element using `first`, or create a list without its first element using `rest`. Create the empty list using `'()`. Or use the `list` function to create a list from zero or more arguments.

**Vectors**, declared using square brackets: `[1 2 true "Lisp"]`. Unlike lists, vectors can't be used to invoke functions.

**Functions** are first-class citizens which capture their environment (except for values defined using `def`). Create them using `fn`, followed by an optional name, a vector containing parameter bindings, and one or more forms comprising the function body. Multiple arities can be defined by passing in one or more lists, each of which starts with a vector containing parameter bindings followed by the function body. Define varargs by passing in a parameter binding vector ending with `&` and the name of a vector to place the rest of the arguments (e.g. `[a b & others]`). To create a function you can call by name later, use the workaround `(def *name* (fn [*args*] *body*))`.

**Macros** are like functions, except that their arguments aren't evaluated before being passed in and the output is intended to be a form which can be further evaluated at runtime. Like functions, macros capture their (non parameter binding) context. Create them using `defmacro`. Macros can be defined with multiple arities and/or varargs.

**Let-binding**, using `let`, allows you to create a lexical context with new bindings available only within the scope of that context.

**Vars** are global bindings to a value that can be rebound as desired. Create them using `def` (e.g. `def myVar 100`).

**Basic types** include booleans (`true` and `false`), `nil`, floating-point numbers (e.g. `1.234`), and string literals (e.g. `"this is a string literal"`).

**Comments** start with a semicolon and continue until the end of the current line: `; this is a comment`


### Completed

- Interpreter core
- Lexer and parser
- Special forms: `quote`, `if`, `do`, `def`, `let`, `fn`, `cons`, `first`, `rest`, `defmacro`, `loop`, `recur`
- Reader macros: `'` (for quoting)
- Collection built-in functions: `list`, `vector`
- I/O built-in functions: `print`
- Type-checking built-in functions: `number?`, `string?`, `symbol?`, `fn?`, `eval?`, `true?`, `false?`, `list?`, `vector?`
- Arithmetic built-in functions: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Comparison built-in functions: `=`, `<`, `>`


### Working On

- Standard library
- Distinction between integers and floating-point values
- Support for maps
- Support for sets
- Support for keywords
- Support for syntax quoting
- Basic namespacing
- Better error handling than simply crashing the REPL
- Improved REPL
- Ability to type in multiple forms at the top level; ability to read and execute from file
- Metacontext - allow consumer to define custom functions visible to the user
- Performance optimization (once development stabilizes)
- Full unit test suite (once development stabilizes)

Lambdatron
==========

A personal project attempting to implement a REPL for a simple Lisp-like language. The initial goal is to build a REPL that can interpret arbitrarily nested prefix arithmetic (e.g. `(+ (/ 1 2) (* 3 (- 5 2)))`). The (very distant) eventual goal might be to build something that conforms to the Scheme standard, or alternately a lightweight dialect of Clojure.

Application
-----------

Lambdatron is an OS X command-line application written in Swift. Type expressions at the command prompt and press 'Enter'.

Need ideas? Try:

- `(+ 1 2 3)`
- `(+ (* 2 4) (- 8 6) (+ (+ 1 3) 4))`
- `(cons 1 (quote (2 3 4)))`
- `(first (quote (6 7 8)))`
- `(rest (quote (6 7 8)))`


Library
-------

While Lambdatron is currently way too immature/incomplete to actually do so, the goal is to eventually package it as a library so that it can be included into larger Swift applications as an embedded scripting language. This might be a good fit for applications where extensibility is more important than raw performance.


Completed Features
------------------

- Interpreter core
- Basic lexing and parsing of text input into cons-based AST
- Special forms: `quote`, `if`, `do`
- I/O functions: `print` 
- Arithmetic functions: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Comparison functions: `=`, `<`, `>`
- List functions: `cons`, `first`, `rest`


Working On
----------

- I/O functions
- Special forms
- Basic control flow
- Logical operators
- Distinction between integers and floating-point values
- Support for vectors
- Support for maps
- Support for keywords
- Support for macros
- Support for syntax quoting
- Better error handling than simply crashing the REPL
- User-defined functions
- Closures
- Proper lexical scope and function stack
- Support for control characters when parsing input (e.g. \")

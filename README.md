Lambdatron
==========

A personal project attempting to implement a simple REPL for a Lisp-like language. The initial goal is to build a REPL that can interpret arbitrarily nested prefix arithmetic (e.g. (+ (/ 1 2) (* 3 (- 5 2)))). The (very distant) eventual goal is to build something that conforms to the Scheme standard.

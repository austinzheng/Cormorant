Lambdatron
==========

An interpreter for a simple Lisp dialect, implemented in Swift. Syntax and conventions are modeled off [Clojure's](http://clojure.org/). Eventual goal is a library that can be used independently of the REPL front-end.

The name is provisional and will be changed once I come up with something better.


Application
-----------

Lambdatron is an OS X command-line application written in Swift. You will need Xcode 6.1 or later to build. Type expressions at the command prompt and press 'Enter'.

Need ideas? Try:

**Basic arithmetic**

- `(+ (* 2 4) (- 8 6) (+ (+ 1 3) 4))`

**Working with lists**

- `(cons 1 '(2 3 4))`
- `(rest '(1 2 3 4 5))`

**Defining and calling a function**

- `(def myfunc (fn [a b] (+ a b 1)))`, then `(myfunc 10 20)`

**Recursion and iteration**

- `(def r (fn [a] (print a " ") (if (> a 0) (r (- a 1)))))`, then `(r 10)`
- `(def recadd (fn [mylist sofar] (if (= (first mylist) nil) sofar (recur (rest mylist) (+ (first mylist) sofar)))))`, then `(recadd '(1 2 3 4 5) 0)`
- `(loop [a 10 b 0] (if (= a 0) b (recur (- a 1) (+ b a))))`

**Creating and using a macro**

- `(defmacro when [__MACRO_pred __MACRO_do] (list 'if __MACRO_pred __MACRO_do nil))`, then `(when (= 1 1) "good")` or `(when (= 1 2) "bad")`

**Defining a function returning another one**

- `(def f1 (fn [arg1] (fn [arg2] (+ arg1 arg2))))`, then `(let [plusone (f1 1)] (plusone 3))`

### Current Limitations

Lambdatron has a couple of limitations, due mostly to its work-in-progress status:

- The REPL is fragile. Don't press the arrow keys while inside it, for example. Copy-pasting text works fine.
- The REPL can only take one form at a time.
- There currently isn't any namespacing or symbol mangling, so be careful when defining macros (e.g. don't use `& rest` as a vararg).
- Macros are cumbersome to define since the syntax-quote system hasn't yet been implemented.

These will disappear as the feature set is filled out.


Features
--------

Lambdatron has the following features:

**Lists**, the bread and butter of Lisp. Create a list using `cons`, extract the first element using `first`, or create a list without its first element using `rest`. Create the empty list using `'()`. Or use the `list` function to create a list from zero or more arguments.

**Vectors**, declared using square brackets: `[1 2 true "Lisp"]`. Unlike lists, vectors can't be eval'ed.

**Functions** are first-class citizens which capture their environment (except for values defined using `def`). Create them using `fn`, followed by an optional name, a vector containing parameter bindings, and one or more forms comprising the function body. Multiple arities can be defined by passing in one or more lists, each of which starts with a vector containing parameter bindings followed by the function body. Define varargs by passing in a parameter binding vector ending with `&` and the name of a vector to place the rest of the arguments (e.g. `[a b & others]`).

**Macros** are like functions, except that their arguments aren't evaluated before being passed in and the output is intended to be a form which can be further evaluated at runtime. Macros are expanded using the bindings at the time expansion happens, not the bindings at the time they were created (as is true with functions). Create them using `defmacro`. Macros can be defined with multiple arities and/or varargs.

**Let-binding**, using `let`, allows you to create a lexical context with new bindings available only within the scope of that context.


### Completed

- Interpreter core
- Lexer and parser
- Special forms: `quote`, `if`, `do`, `def`, `let`, `fn`, `cons`, `first`, `rest`, `defmacro`, `loop`, `recur`
- Reader macros: `'` (for quoting)
- Collection built-in functions: `list`, `vector`
- I/O built-in functions: `print` 
- Arithmetic built-in functions: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Comparison built-in functions: `=`, `<`, `>`


### Working On

- Standard library
- Distinction between integers and floating-point values
- Support for maps
- Support for keywords
- Support for syntax quoting
- Basic namespacing
- Better error handling than simply crashing the REPL
- Improved REPL
- Ability to type in multiple forms at the top level; ability to read and execute from file
- Metacontext - allow consumer to define custom functions visible to the user
- Performance optimization (once development stabilizes)
- Full unit test suite (once development stabilizes)

Lambdatron
==========

An interpreter for a non-trivial subset of [Clojure](http://clojure.org/), implemented in Swift. The interpreter endeavors to match Clojure's behavior as closely as possible. The eventual goal is a library that can be used independently of the REPL front-end.


Application
-----------

Lambdatron is an OS X command-line application written in Swift. You will need Xcode 6.1 or later to build.

Run the executable either from within Xcode, or directly from the command line. Run with no arguments to start the interactive REPL, or run with the argument `-f <FILENAME>` to have the interpreter run code within a file. When in the REPL, type expressions at the command prompt and press 'Enter'.

[Grimoire](http://conj.io/) is a high-quality Clojure API reference, and can be used to reference the intended behavior of all included functions and special forms.

Need ideas? Try:

**Basic arithmetic**

- `(+ (* 2 4) (- 8 6) (+ (+ 1 3) 4))`

**Working with collections**

- `(cons 1 '(2 3 4))`
- `(rest '(1 2 3 4 5))`
- `(concat '(1 2 3) [4 5] {"six" 6 "seven" 7})`
- `(seq {1 "one" 2 true "three" [nil]})`

**Defining and calling a function**

- `(defn myfunc [a b] (+ a b 1))`, then `(myfunc 10 20)`
- Functions returning functions: `(defn f1 [arg1] (fn [arg2] (+ arg1 arg2)))`, then `(let [plusone (f1 1)] (plusone 3))`

**Recursion and iteration**

- Basic recursion: `(defn r [a] (print a " ") (if (> a 0) (r (- a 1))))`, then `(r 10)`
- Tail-call recursion using recur: `(defn recadd [mylist sofar] (if (= (first mylist) nil) sofar (recur (rest mylist) (+ (first mylist) sofar))))`, then `(recadd '(1 2 3 4 5) 0)`
- Iteration using loops: `(loop [a 10 b 0] (if (= a 0) b (recur (- a 1) (+ b a))))`

**Creating and using a macro**

- ``(defmacro my-when [predicate then-do] `(if ~predicate ~then-do nil))``, then `(my-when (= 1 1) "good")` or `(my-when (= 1 2) (do (print "this shouldn't show up") "bad"))`


### Current Limitations

Lambdatron has a couple of limitations, due mostly to its work-in-progress status:

- The REPL can only take one form at a time.
- There currently isn't any namespacing or symbol mangling, so be careful when defining macros (e.g. don't use `& rest` as a vararg).

These will disappear as the feature set is filled out.


Features
--------

Lambdatron has the following features:

**Lists**, the bread and butter of Lisp. Create a list using `cons`, extract the first element using `first`, or create a list without its first element using `rest`. Create the empty list using `'()`. Or use the `list` function to create a list from zero or more arguments.

**Vectors**, declared using square brackets: `[1 2 true "Lisp"]`, or the `vector` function. Unlike lists, vectors can't be used to invoke functions. Vectors can be used in function position with an integer index argument.

**Maps**, declared using braces: `{"one" 1 "two" nil "three" [1 2 3]}`, or the `hash-map` function. Maps can be used in function position in order to get a value for a key.

**Strings**, declared using double quotes: `"this is a string literal"`. Strings can be manipulated using `first`, `rest`, etc.

**Functions** are first-class citizens which capture their environment (except for values defined using `def`). Create them using `fn`, followed by an optional name, a vector containing parameter bindings, and one or more forms comprising the function body. Or create a function bound to a global name using `defn`. Multiple arities can be defined by passing in one or more lists, each of which starts with a vector containing parameter bindings followed by the function body. Define varargs by passing in a parameter binding vector ending with `&` and the name of a vector to place the rest of the arguments (e.g. `[a b & others]`).

**Macros** are like functions, except that their arguments aren't evaluated before being passed in and the output is intended to be a form which can be further evaluated at runtime. Like functions, macros capture their (non parameter binding) context. Create them using `defmacro`. Macros can be defined with multiple arities and/or varargs.

**Let-binding**, using `let`, allows you to create a lexical context with new bindings available only within the scope of that context.

**Vars** are global bindings to a value that can be rebound as desired. Create them using `def` (e.g. `def myVar 100`).

**Basic types** include:
* Booleans (`true` and `false`)
* `nil`
* integers
* floating-point numbers (e.g. `1.234`)
* character literals (`\a`, `\tab`, `\space`, `\newline`, `\return`), which can be used in function position
* keywords (`:else`), which can be used in function position

**Syntax-quote** makes defining macros slightly less tedious. Use `'` to denote a normal quoted form. Use `` ` `` to denote a quote that should be syntax-quoted; within such a form `~` (unquote) can be used to force evaluation of the unquote form, while `~@` (unquote-splice) can be used to force evaluation of a form to a collection whose elements are then spliced in.

**Comments** start with a semicolon and continue until the end of the current line: `; this is a comment`

The following special forms, reader macros, and functions are built into the interpreter:

- Special forms: `quote`, `if`, `do`, `def`, `let`, `fn`, `defmacro`, `loop`, `recur`, `apply`, `attempt`
- Reader macros: `'`, `` ` ``, `~`, `~@`
- Collection manipulation: `list`, `vector`, `hash-map`, `cons`, `first`, `next`, `rest`, `concat`, `nth`, `seq`, `get`, `assoc`, `dissoc`
- Primitive manipulation: `symbol`, `keyword`, `int`, `double`
- I/O: `print`
- Testing: `nil?`, `number?`, `int?`, `float?`, `string?`, `symbol?`, `fn?`, `eval?`, `true?`, `false?`, `list?`, `vector?`, `map?`, `seq?`, `pos?`, `neg?`, `zero?`, `subnormal?`, `infinite?`, `nan?`
- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `rem`, `quot`
- Comparison: `=`, `==`, `<`, `>`
- Miscellaneous: `eval`, `fail`


Development
-----------

Some notes on Lambdatron development tools follow.

### Debugging

Note that running (or profiling) Lambdatron in Xcode will open the REPL up in a new instance of Terminal.app, rather than in Xcode's built-in console. If you wish to debug, after starting Lambdatron, go to the Debug menu in Xcode --> Attach to Process, and then choose the process named "Lambdatron" (it should show up under "Likely Targets").


### Profiling

Unfortunately profiling is a little more cumbersome to set up. After you've chosen which Instrument you want to use, you have to click the red Record button, then wait half a second, then click on the dropdown list that says "Terminal.app" and select "Lambdatron" from the "System Processes" section. Then press the square Stop button, and press it again to begin recording in earnest.

The current Xcode scheme is set to build an optimized version of Lambdatron when profiling (and a debug version when running normally). There is a significant performance difference between the two versions, be aware.


### Logging

Logging is in an embryonic state. In the REPL, type `?logging <DOMAIN> on` or `?logging <DOMAIN> off` to turn logging on or off for a given domain, or omit the `<DOMAIN>` argument to turn logging on or off globally.

The only currently supported domain is `eval`. This logging domain prints out messages detailing how macros, functions, etc are evaluated, and can be useful to see exactly what the interpreter is doing when it evaluates a form.


### Unit Tests

Lambdatron has a unit test target. Run the unit tests from within Xcode.


Development Objectives
----------------------

Development objectives can be divided into two categories.

### Working On

These are objectives I am working on right now, or plan on doing in the near future.

- Expanding standard library
- Support for sets
- Basic namespacing
- Ability to type in multiple forms at the top level
- Metacontext - allow consumer to define custom functions visible to the user
- Performance optimization (once development stabilizes)
- Full unit test suite (once development stabilizes)


### (Very) Long Term Goals

These are objectives that are either too big in scope to schedule, too technically challenging at this time, or of uncertain utility.

- Persistent data structures
- Proper support for lazy collections
- STM and support for multithreading
- Metadata
- Destructuring via pattern matching
- Rationals and bignums (may need to wait for a suitable Swift library handling these first)
- Interpreter rewrite (compile to bytecode rather than direct interpretation) - probably as a separate project
- Full Foundation/Cocoa bindings
- Better Swift runtime interop (if proper reflection support ever comes to Swift)
- Port to Rust


Differences From Clojure
------------------------

Aside from the (long) list of features not yet implemented (see the *Working On* and *(Very) Long Term Goals* sections above), there are a couple of intentional deviations from Clojure's API or conventions:

* `ifn?` doesn't exist; use `eval?` instead. This is because Lambdatron does not use protocols (i.e. interfaces) to define constructs that can be used in function position.
* `try` doesn't exist. `attempt` is a (very basic) error handling facility. It takes one or more forms, executing each sequentially, and returns the first successful value (or the error from executing the final form).
* The `byte`, `short`, `long`, and `float` functions are not implemented, as Lambdatron only has an integer and a double-precision floating point numerical data type.
* The `subnormal?`, `infinite?`, and `nan?` functions return false for integer arguments, and can be used to test whether floating point numbers are subnormal, infinite, or NaN (respectively).
* `keyword` returns `nil` if given an empty string as an argument, not an invalid empty symbol.
* Only the `\return`, `\newline`, `\tab`, and `\space` special character literals are supported. The `\uNNNN` and `\oNNN` forms are not supported.
